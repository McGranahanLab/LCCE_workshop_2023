    "The workshop is based on data generated by the TRACERx (Tracking Cancer Evolution through Therapy (Rx) project. It is a large-scale research project aimed at understanding how cancer evolves and spreads over time. The project involves collecting multiple samples of tumours and analysing them in detail to identify genetic changes that occur as the cancer progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **1,644 tumour regions** were sampled at surgery or during follow-up from the first **421 patients** with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The samples were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq and thoroughly analysed. In total, **432 genomically distinct tumours** were found. The results obtained from this analysis serve as the foundation for generating hypotheses during this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available data include:\n",
    "1. patient pathology and clinical data\n",
    "2. somatic mutations\n",
    "3. somatic copy number alterations\n",
    "4. expression data\n",
    "\n",
    "While rudimentary plots summarising the data are available below, we highly encourage you to have a brief look through the [collection of TRACERx papers](https://www.nature.com/collections/haffgaicaf). In particular, somatic point and copy number alterations are discussed [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05783-5) and expression changes are examined [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05706-4)."
